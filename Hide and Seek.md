## SECTION 1: QUICKSTART GUIDE

### OVERVIEW

Welcome to *Hide And Seek!* Let's cut to the chase: this is a long rulebook. But we promise that ultimately, this game is pretty simple. The basic gameplay can be summed up in five steps:

1. One player uses **public transit** to get to a **hiding spot**.

2. The other players work together to find them by **asking questions** about their location, chosen from our **six question categories**.

3. Each time the hider answers a question, they draw cards from the **hider deck**. These cards give them advantages in the game.

4. Once the hider is found by the seekers, another player hides.

5. At the end, **whoever hid the longest wins**.

While the overall structure is simple, there's a bit more you'll need to know before playing. Starting with:

### CHOOSING GAME SIZE

*Hide and Seek* is configured to be played at three different scales: **small, medium, or large**. These sizes have slightly different rules designed to work best with your map's size and complexity. Before you do any further set up, you'll need to determine whether you'd like to play a small, medium, or large game of *Hide and Seek*.

**SMALL** - Spans a single town, small city, or portion of a large city; lasts 4-8 hours
*Examples: Lower Manhattan; Winston-Salem, NC*

**MEDIUM** - Spans a major city, metro area, or region; lasts about 1 day
*Examples: Hong Kong; New York City; Greater London, UK*

**LARGE** - Spans a large region, an entire country, or several small countries; lasts 2 to 4 days
*Examples: Switzerland; Japan; New England, US*

The other major decision that will need to be made concerning game length is whether you want to add **additional rounds**. In the simplest configuration of the game, each player/team hides a single time—once everyone has had a chance to hide, the longest hiding time wins. **We consider hiding once per player to be the default version of the game**, and it's what we recommend unless you are willing to commit significantly more time to playing. If you do choose to add additional rounds, hiding time is not counted cumulatively—it is only a player's best round that counts.

### CREATING TEAMS

Generally, **we do not recommend playing with more than four players**. If you do want to play with more than four players, we would suggest grouping some players into teams. These teams (of two or more) could effectively act as a single player, all hiding together when it is their turn to hide. There may be some unforeseen awkwardness with how to answer certain questions that are intended for a single player, which will need to be resolved on a case-by-case basis. Teams are also recommended when playing with younger players, or in any context where a hider would feel unsafe or uncomfortable being alone for an extended period of time.

### SETTING YOUR MAP

After you have chosen a game size and assembled your players, you'll need to set up your game map. This involves choosing a **transit system** and establishing **map borders**. (For more information on setting up your map, turn to page 9.)

### ROUND START

At the start of each round, one player/team will become the hider, while the remaining players will band together to play as that round's seekers. The order in which each player hides should be determined, at random, before the game begins.

While all players are still at the starting location—which can be anywhere within the game map—there are a few items to be distributed. The hider receives the **hider deck**, and the seekers take the **investigation book**. We also recommend each side takes a **rulebook** to reference in case there is need for clarification or if any rules discrepancies arise. Optionally, the seekers might also choose to print out a map of their game area so that they can mark it as they play, and carry writing implements to take notes. Both sides should also keep at least **two dice** on them at all times, as these are used for various different things throughout the game.

Each round begins with a **hiding period**. During this time, the hider can use their legs and public transit to travel to any transit station within the map's boundaries. Once the hiding period has concluded, the hider must stay within their hiding zone for the rest of the round. The length of the hiding period is determined by game size:

| Game Size | Hiding Period |
|-----------|---------------|
| **SMALL** | 30 minutes |
| **MEDIUM** | 60 minutes |
| **LARGE** | 180 minutes |

Lastly, all seekers should make sure to turn on some form of tracker during this period to ensure that the hider can follow their movements throughout the round. You can use real GPS trackers if you happen to have them, but the easiest option for most people is to download one of the many free smartphone apps that allow other phones to track your phone's location. (We use Apple's "Find My" app, but Google Maps also allows for live location sharing if any players are using Android phones.)

### HIDING ZONES

At the end of the hiding period, the hider must be at a transit station/ stop that is included in the game's map—this now acts as the center of their hiding zone. The hiding zone extends a certain distance in all directions from the transit station, forming a circle within which the hider may move freely until the **end game** begins. For small and medium games, the hiding zone extends 500 m from the transit station; for large games, the hiding zone extends 1 km from the transit station. (For more information on hiding zones and hiding spots, turn to page 41.)

### ASKING QUESTIONS

In order to gather information about the hider's location, the seekers will have to ask questions from the **investigation book**. These questions can be asked at any time, as long as the previous question has been answered, and must be answered truthfully by the hider within 5 minutes, with the exception of photo questions, which must be answered within 10 minutes in small and medium games, and 20 minutes in large games. We ask hiders to make a good faith effort to answer all questions in the allotted time. However, if questions are not answered in the allowed time window, the hider's time is paused until the question is answered, and the hider will receive no cards in exchange for answering.

After a question has been answered, the hider may draw and keep a certain number of cards from the **hider deck**, indicated in the **investigation book**, depending on the category of question asked. (For more information on asking questions, turn to page 13.)

Once a question has been asked, it cannot be asked again unless the seekers choose to **pay its cost twice**. So, for example, a question that would typically allow a hider to draw 3 cards and keep 1 would now allow a hider to draw 3, keep 1, then draw 3, and keep 1 again (importantly: hiders cannot draw 6 and keep 2, they must draw 3 and pull 1 two separate times, in this example.) Should seekers want to ask a question a third time, its cost would be triple; a fourth time, the cost quadrupled, and so on.

As you gather information about the hider's location, you can use the internet for research to develop your theories. **The only prohibited source of information is Google Street View**; everything else is fair game.

### THE HIDER DECK

The hider deck contains three types of cards that the hider can use to their advantage: **time bonus cards, powerup cards, and curse cards**. Cards are drawn after a question is answered, and kept in the hider's hand until they are played or discarded into the discard pile. **The hider can keep 6 cards in their hand at a time** (unless their hand size has been expanded through a powerup.) If, at any point, the hider has exceeded their hand limit, they must immediately play or discard cards until they only have 6 cards remaining. (For more information on the hider deck, turn to page 44.)

### THE END GAME

Once the seekers have entered the hider's hiding zone—and are no longer on a mode of transit—the **end game** will begin. At this point, the hider may no longer move freely; they must stay put in a publicly accessible **hiding spot** until they are found. (For more information on permissible hiding spots, turn to page 43.) During the end game, some questions may be impossible to answer due to restrictions on the hider's movement. For example, a photo question that would require the hider to take a photo from the train station, when they are not at the train station, would not be possible. In these cases, "I cannot answer the question" is considered a valid answer, and the hider would still pull a card. All questions other than photo questions that must be taken from a particular location should be possible to answer during the end game.

### ROTATING ROUNDS

The hider is considered found once the seekers are **within 2 meters of them and have spotted them**. If the seekers are near the hider but haven't yet identified them, then the hider hasn't been caught. At this point, the hider's clock is stopped, and all time bonus cards currently in the hider's hand are added to their time total.

After the hider is caught, the new hider is permitted up to 10 minutes for any final planning before their hiding period begins. During this time, the new seekers should reshuffle all cards back into the deck and hand it off to the new hider, turn on their trackers, exchange the investigation book, and ensure that the new hider's tracker is turned off. They will begin the next round from the last hider's hiding spot.

After each player has completed the predetermined number of hiding rounds, **the player with the longest single hiding run is declared the winner**.

## SECTION 2: SETTING UP YOUR MAP

Our goal, when designing *Hide and Seek*, was to make a game that can be played almost anywhere in the world. In order to accomplish this, we established a few simple steps that should generate a viable game map wherever you choose to play. Here's how to set the parameters of your game:

### CHOOSING A TRANSIT SYSTEM

Your local transit system is the backbone of *Hide and Seek*. While this game can be played with cars or on foot, as we will detail later, we **strongly recommend using public transit for this game**. *Hide and Seek* can be played on trains, trams, metros, light rails, buses, ferries, or any other form of public transit, but you'll need to define which systems are in play before starting your game. Given that each hiding zone will be centered around a transit station, it's crucial that your game includes a sufficient number of stations to keep it engaging and open-ended—this should determine how many different systems you'll want to include. (If, for example, you have a metro system that only has a few dozen stops, you should consider layering a bus system on top of it to increase complexity.)

Here is our best estimate for ideal map size and transit complexity in different scale games:

| Game Size | Transit Complexity/Map Size |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| **SMALL** | 30 – 100 stations; 25 – 250 km² |
| **MEDIUM** | 100 – 500 stations; 250 – 2,500 km² |
| **LARGE** | 500+ stations; 2,500+ km² |

*(As a point of comparison, our game in Switzerland comprised about 1,800 stations, and our game in Japan was slightly over 8,500. Both would be considered "Large.")*

It's also extremely important to **ensure all players feel safe going to all areas of the map**. Players should discuss safety beforehand, and if there are any areas where players would not feel comfortable going, they should be excluded from the map.

### SETTING MAP BORDERS

After you've determined the edges of your transit system, you'll need to establish a set of definitive borders for your game's map. As we've mentioned, the scale of your map is entirely up to you—whether it spans your county or your continent—**but it is crucial that all players are using the exact same set of borders**. In some cases, these borders can be naturally emergent and easily standardized; a game that spans a single country, for example, can simply be contained to the borders of that country. For smaller scale games—like those that take place in a single city or metro area—natural borders might be more ill-defined. (How big is Atlanta? No one knows!) In these cases, we would recommend setting your own hard borders using a tool like *Google My Maps*. Generally, it's best to draw a square or circle that encompasses the totality of the transit system you plan on using for your game.

### CONSIDERING REST PERIODS

If your game is large enough to potentially span multiple days, you will also need to set rest periods for each day. For the sake of fairness, we recommend doing this ahead of time. These can be as long as you'd like, so long as all players reset to their exact positions when the game resumes. We'd recommend a minimum of 10 hours, in order for all players to get sufficient rest.

### ENDING YOUR GAME

Generally, *Hide and Seek* ends once the predetermined number of rounds is complete. If, however, you're playing with a hard out (*i.e. you have a flight home or, you know, need to go to school/work*) we would also recommend setting an end-of-game timer. In that case, the game would end whenever you reach the predetermined number of rounds or the timer runs out, whichever comes first.

---

## SECTION 3: SEEKING

As the seeker, it is your job to move and gather information as efficiently as possible. At your disposal are 80 questions, which you can ask the hider at any time. The hider must answer all of your questions truthfully, but in exchange for answers, they'll be rewarded with cards from their hider deck. Choosing the right questions at the right time is the key to a quick round—ask too many and you'll be bogged down with curses or blown out with hours of time bonuses.

To make sorting through these questions easier, **we've divided them into six simple categories**. All of the questions in the same category cost the same number of cards, and share the same sentence structure—it's simply a matter of choosing a noun or value. Some categories are more useful during different stages of your search, so be sure to keep an open mind and change up your strategy as you close in on the hider.

You cannot ask multiple questions at once; if you are waiting on an answer from a previous question, you cannot ask your next question until the first has been answered.

You can use the internet for research, but **you cannot use Google Street View**. We have found Street View to be far too powerful when it comes to matching photos, and it makes the game generally less fun. This is our only strict rule about research, though you can choose to implement other rules if your group deems them necessary, such as an additional ban on searching for *any* images of train stations.

As you collect information, you should record it in your investigation book and on a printout of your game map. There are many types of information you can collect in a given round—photos, directions, and context clues—and you'll want to stay on top of everything if you want any chance at finding your hider.

### A NOTE ABOUT MAPPING APPS (AND THEIR ERRORS)

Easily playing this game is going to require using a maps app on your smartphone or other device. We'll just say right now: **we recommend that you use Google Maps for playing this game**. We designed the game, and our question categories, with Google Maps in mind, so you'll likely get the best gameplay when using it. It's also the only major mapping app where it is easy to measure distances, which will often be necessary for questions. In order to measure a distance, hold down anywhere on Google Maps that is not a formally listed location. A pin will pop up and if you scroll down you can select "measure distance," then drag to measure from that point. We will mention that Apple Maps has superior rail visualization, and occasionally more accurate timetables, so it is useful for certain game aspects. When we play, we use Apple Maps to see rail options and game out hypothetical routes, but Google Maps for everything else.

You'll notice that many of our questions reference various categories of businesses or locations: parks, zoos, hospitals, museums, etc. We chose these carefully—almost all of them have their own special categorization in Google Maps and Apple Maps, with their own special little icon to help you easily see them. Amusement parks have a ferris wheel icon, libraries have a book, and so on. You should be able to easily see all the places that fall under a given category by simply searching that category in your app and looking for those icons. Unfortunately, you'll notice there are sometimes categorization errors. A random parking lot will be erroneously listed as an amusement park, for example. Determining what is an error and what is not is often subjective, but given the need for objective rules, here is our criteria:

#### IF YOU ARE USING GOOGLE MAPS:

Anywhere with 5 or more Google Reviews is assumed to be legitimate, unless all players can agree otherwise. Anywhere with fewer than 5 Google Reviews is assumed to be illegitimate, unless all players can agree otherwise.

#### IF YOU ARE USING APPLE MAPS, OR ANOTHER MAPPING APP:

Everywhere is assumed to be legitimate, unless all players can agree otherwise.

Whatever app you choose, **it's very important that the hider and seekers are using the same maps app** when searching in these categories. If the seekers and hiders search on different apps, they will often get different results, leading to confusion.

In general, **it is the responsibility of the seekers to clarify any ambiguity in what they are asking**—for example, by sending a screenshot of everything they understand to qualify as an amusement park when asking if the hider is near one.

### MATCHING QUESTIONS

Matching questions follow the format, "Is your nearest _____ the same as my _____?" Valid answers are **yes** or **no**. Hiders have five minutes to answer. These questions can be useful at any point in the game, though they often require the seekers to move in order to optimize their efficacy. **It is important to note that if locations are not within a map's boundaries, players must operate as if they do not exist**. For example, if the seekers asked if they shared the same nearest commercial airport as the hider, but the only commercial airports were outside the map's boundaries, it would return a null answer (null answers count as answered questions, and hiders get to draw cards).

After a matching question has been answered, the hider may **draw 3 cards and keep 1**.

Here's a little diagram to help illustrate how matching questions can work:

**IS YOUR NEAREST MOUNTAIN THE SAME AS MY NEAREST MOUNTAIN?**

[Diagram showing Mountain #1, Mountain #2, and Mountain #3 with Seekers near Mountain #2]

These are the matching questions available to the seekers:

#### TRANSIT

**Commercial Airport**
If there is any ambiguity, an airport is considered commercial if you can view flights to/from it via Google Flights (flights.google.com).

**Transit Line**
*Important: In order to ask this question, seekers must be on the form of transit, and it must be moving.*

The answer is yes if the transit the seekers are currently riding would stop at the hider's station. For clarity, best practice is for seekers to screenshot all the stations their transit will stop at and send them to the hider.

If the seekers are on a limited-stop/express train that passes through the hider's station but does not stop at it, the hider should answer "no." A "yes" answer is only given when the seekers' train would *stop* at the hider's station.

**Station Name's Length**
Number of characters (hyphens and spaces count) in the station, as defined by your mapping app. If the app includes the word "station," that counts.

**Street or Path**
A street or path is considered to have ended when it acquires a different name. This includes changing from, say, "Jet Lag St. East" to "Jet Lag St. West"

If the street or path is unnamed, it is considered to start or end wherever it has an intersection.

#### ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS

**1st Administrative Division**
This is the biggest formal category of division. For the US, it would be states. In Switzerland, cantons. In Japan, prefectures.

**2nd Administrative Division**
A more detailed level of division. In the US, this is counties. In Switzerland, districts. In Japan, subprefectures.

**3rd Administrative Division**
One more level down. In the US, Switzerland, and Japan, this would be municipality. Municipality borders can be occasionally difficult to define, so it's up to the seekers to clarify any ambiguity.

**4th Administrative Division**
Some places have no fourth administrative division, but many larger cities do. For example, New York City has boroughs, Zurich has districts, Tokyo has special wards.

#### NATURAL

**Mountain**
Anything correctly classified as a mountain by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Landmass**
An area of land that is in one piece, not broken up by a waterway. If the hider is on a landmass that is entirely surrounded by the landmass the seekers are on, it counts as a match.

We urge players to be reasonable about this. There's a lot of interesting geography discussion to be had about what's its own landmass and what isn't. Is Cape Cod its own landmass or part of a peninsula, merely cut off by an artificial waterway? Hard to say! If your geography has any weird edge cases, we encourage you to discuss them beforehand. In game, as always, it is up to the seekers to clarify any ambiguity when they are asking a question.

**Park**
Anything correctly classified as a park by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

There's a possibility that measuring to the map icon can lead to strange outcomes—for example, if you are in a very large park but far from the center, you may be several kilometers from that park's map icon. You might be closer to the icon of a smaller, nearby park. This could mean that you are forced to say that your nearest park is the small one even though you are literally in the bigger park. Nonetheless, measuring to the map icon is the best, most objective way we've found to handle these questions, so we encourage sticking to that system even when it produces these edge case outcomes.

#### PLACES OF INTEREST

**Amusement Park**
Anything correctly categorized as an amusement park by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Zoo**
Anything correctly categorized as a zoo by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Aquarium**
Anything correctly categorized as an aquarium by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Golf Course**
An outdoor golf course. Miniature golf does not count. Driving ranges do not count. Measure distance from the map icon.

*We urge seekers to clarify their understanding of what counts when sending this question.*

**Museum**
Anything correctly categorized as a museum by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Movie Theater**
Anything correctly categorized as a movie theater by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

#### PUBLIC UTILITIES

**Hospital**
Anything correctly categorized as a hospital by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Library**
Anything correctly categorized as a library by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Foreign Consulate**
Anything correctly categorized as a foreign consulate by your mapping app. Exclude honorary consulates. Measure distance from the map icon.

### MEASURING QUESTIONS

Measuring questions follow the format, "compared to me, are you closer to or further from _____?" Valid answers are **closer** or **further**. Hiders have five minutes to answer. These questions are also universally useful, and good for slicing the map in unique and clever ways. **It is important to note that if locations are not within a map's boundaries, players must operate as if they do not exist**. For example, if the seekers asked if they were closer to or further from an international border than the hider, but there were no international borders in the map's boundaries, it would return a null answer (null answers count as answered questions, and hiders get to draw cards).

After a measuring question has been answered, the hider may **draw 3 cards and keep 1**.

Here are two little diagrams to help illustrate how measuring questions can work:

**COMPARED TO ME, ARE YOU CLOSER TO OR FURTHER FROM A COASTLINE?**

[Diagram showing Potential Hider Area If Closer and Potential Hider Area If Further relative to coastline and Seekers position]

**COMPARED TO ME, ARE YOU CLOSER TO OR FURTHER FROM AN AIRPORT?**

[Diagram showing Airport #3, Airport #2, Airport #1, Potential Hider Area If Closer, Potential Hider Area If Further, and Seekers position]

These are the measuring questions available to the seekers:

#### TRANSIT-RELATED

**Commercial Airport**
If there is any ambiguity, an airport is considered commercial if you can view flights to/from it via Google Flights (flights.google.com).

**High-Speed Train Line**
Different countries sometimes have different definitions of high-speed rail, so it is worth using whatever definition is locally applicable. Otherwise, we recommend following the EU definition: *Minimum speed of 250 km/h (155 mph) on lines specially built for high speed and of about 200 km/h (124 mph) on existing lines which have been specially upgraded.*

**Rail Station**
Includes light and heavy rail; metros/subways count.

#### BORDERS

**International Border**
Enclaves count!

**1st Administrative Division Border**
This is a border between the biggest formal category of division. For the US, it would be states. In Switzerland, cantons. In Japan, prefectures.

**2nd Administrative Division Border**
This is a border between the next level of division. In the US, this is counties. In Switzerland, districts. In Japan, subprefectures.

#### NATURAL

**Sea Level**
This refers to a player's altitude.

You can find this using your phone's compass. Fair warning: sometimes the compass is wrong, so don't rely too heavily on this being 100% accurate.

**Body of Water**
Any named body of water on your maps app, excluding pools.

**Coastline**
Okay, so: defining where a coastline begins is a famously difficult geographical question. Here is the definition we have developed—we're not saying it's perfect, but at least it is objective.

For our purposes, a coastline is defined as: any place where land meets either the ocean, a great lake, or a body of water that flows directly into the ocean or great lake via a waterway that is never less than 2 km across.

You can see this illustrated below:

[Diagram showing coastline definition with "YES A COASTLINE", "LAND", "NOT A COASTLINE", "OCEAN" labels]

We recommend you don't rely on this to be super precise, and that you consult with each other if there's any weirdness.

**Mountain**
Anything correctly classified as a mountain by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Park**
Anything correctly classified as a park by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon. As noted in the park matching question, this could lead to strangeness. If you are in a large park, 2 km from the park icon, you might have to say you are 2 km away from any park despite the fact that you are in a park. Nonetheless, we believe measuring to the icon is the cleanest and most objective system.

#### PLACES OF INTEREST

**Amusement Park**
Anything correctly categorized as an amusement park by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Zoo**
Anything correctly categorized as a zoo by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Aquarium**
Anything correctly categorized as an aquarium by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Golf Course**
An outdoor golf course. Miniature golf does not count. Driving ranges do not count. Measure distance from the map icon.

*We urge seekers to clarify their understanding of what counts when sending this question.*

**Museum**
Anything correctly categorized as a museum by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Movie Theater**
Anything correctly categorized as a movie theater by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

#### PUBLIC UTILITIES

**Hospital**
Anything correctly categorized as a hospital by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Library**
Anything correctly categorized as a library by your mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.

**Foreign Consulate**
Anything correctly categorized as a foreign consulate by your mapping app. Exclude honorary consulates. Measure distance from the map icon.

### RADAR QUESTIONS

Radar questions follow the format, "Are you within _____ of me?" Valid answers are **yes** or **no**. Hiders have five minutes to answer. These questions are a good way of verifying whether you are in the right general area, or crossing off a particularly dense part of the map. It is easiest to measure these distances using a long press or right click in Google Maps, and using the "Measure" tool.) It's important to note that radars are asking about your location, not your hiding zone. If the radar would encompass part of your hiding zone, but not your location at the time of answering, it would be a miss.

After a radar question has been answered, the hider may **draw 2 cards and keep 1**.

Here's a little diagram to help illustrate how radar questions can work:

**ARE YOU WITHIN 160 KM OF ME?**

[Diagram showing 160 KM radius with Remaining Hider Area If "No", Potential Hider Area If "Yes", Start Point, and End Point]

These are the radar questions available to the seekers:

- 500 m
- 1 km
- 2 km
- 5 km
- 10 km
- 15 km
- 40 km
- 80 km
- 160 km
- Choose (for this, you may use any distance you wish)

### THERMOMETER QUESTIONS

Thermometer questions follow the format, "After traveling _____, am I hotter or colder?" Valid answers are **hotter** or **colder**. Hiders have five minutes to answer. When starting a thermometer question, you should inform the hider that you are starting a thermometer and send them your current location (we recommend sending a pin through Google or Apple Maps.) Then, after traveling a sufficient distance—measured as the crow flies—send them your new location. If the new location is closer to the hider's current location, then you are hotter. Otherwise, you are colder. These questions are a good way of determining whether you are moving in the right direction.

After a thermometer question has been answered, the hider may **draw 2 cards and keep 1**.

Here's a little diagram to help illustrate how thermometer questions can work:

**AFTER TRAVELING 15 KM, AM I HOTTER OR COLDER?**

[Diagram showing Remaining Hider Area If Colder, Remaining Hider Area If Hotter, 15 KM distance, Start Point, and End Point]

These are the thermometer questions available to the seekers in **SMALL** sized games:

- 1 km
- 5 km

#### FOR MEDIUM AND LARGE SIZED GAMES, ADD THE FOLLOWING:

- 15 km

#### FOR LARGE SIZED GAMES, ADD THE FOLLOWING:

- 75 km

### PHOTO QUESTIONS

Photo questions follow the format, "Send me a photo of _____." Valid answers are a photo that meets the full specifications of the photo question, or "I cannot answer the question," in situations where the subject of the photograph doesn't exist in the hiding zone. Hiders have ten minutes to answer in small and medium games, and twenty minutes to answer in large games. All photos must be sent in your phone's normal aspect ratio. Photos are a useful way of getting a general sense of where the hider is, or for verifying that you've arrived at the right location, but you cannot use Google Street View to assess photos or verify stations from afar.

These are the photo questions available to the seekers in **small sized games**:

**Any Building Visible from Transit Station**
Must stand directly outside a station entrance. If there are multiple entrances, you may choose. Must include roof and both sides, with the top of the building in the top ⅓ of the frame.

**Widest Street**
Must include both sides of the street; does not have to include background.

**Tree**
Must include the entire tree.

**Tallest Structure In Your Current Sightline**
This is the tallest building from your perspective, not the objectively tallest building. If you can see the Burj Khalifa a long way away, but a nearby apartment building is taller from your perspective/sightline, you would send the apartment building.

Must include top and both sides. The top must be in the top ⅓ of the frame.

**You**
Selfie mode. Phone perpendicular to ground, arm fully extended, using your phone's default lens with no zoom.

**The Sky**
Place phone on ground, shoot directly up using your phone's default lens with no zoom.

#### FOR MEDIUM AND LARGE SIZED GAMES, ADD THE FOLLOWING:

**Tallest Building Visible from Transit Station**
This is the tallest building from your perspective, not the objectively tallest building. If you can see the Burj Khalifa a long way away, but a nearby apartment building is taller from your perspective/sightline, you would send the apartment building.

Must stand directly outside a station entrance. If there are multiple entrances, you may choose. Must include roof and both sides, with the top of the building in the top ⅓ of the frame.

In general, the transit station itself cannot count as the tallest building visible from the transit station. The exception would be if atop the transit station is a tall building whose purpose is unrelated to the transit station. For example, atop Grand Central Station is the MetLife building. This would count as the tallest building visible from the transit station.

**Trace Nearest Street/Path**
Street/path must be visible on mapping app; trace intersection to intersection.

This can be a little tricky to do; we have a few methods. One is to screenshot this on your phone, then use the drawing tools on your phone's photo editing app to black out everything but the street. Another is to put a piece of paper over your phone and trace with a pen/pencil/marker.

**2 Buildings**
Must include bottom and up to four stories.

**Restaurant Interior**
No zoom. Must take the picture through the window from outside the restaurant.

**Park**
No zoom, phone perpendicular to ground. Must stand 2 meters from any obstruction.

**Grocery Store Aisle**
No zoom. Stand at the end of the aisle, shoot directly down.

**Place of Worship**
Must include a 2m × 2m section with three distinct elements. The litmus test for the distinct elements is: if someone went to that place and found what you took a picture of, they could confidently match it, and be sure it wasn't taken somewhere else.

**Train Platform**
Must include a 2m × 2m section with three distinct elements. The litmus test for the distinct elements is: if someone went to that place and found what you took a picture of, they could confidently match it, and be sure it wasn't taken somewhere else.

#### FOR LARGE SIZED GAMES, ADD THE FOLLOWING:

**1 km of Streets Traced**
Must be continuous, include 5 turns, with no doubling back. Send north-south oriented. Streets must appear on mapping app.

As mentioned before, this can be a little tricky to do; we have a few methods. One is to screenshot this on your phone, then use the drawing tools on your phone's photo editing app to black out everything but the street. Another is to put a piece of paper over your phone and trace with a pen/pencil/marker.

**Tallest Mountain Visible from Transit Station**
Tallest from your perspective/sightline. If you could see Mount Everest many many kilometers away, but another nearby mountain looks taller from your perspective, you would send the nearby mountain.

Max 3x zoom; top of mountain must be in top ⅓ of frame.

**The Biggest Body of Water in Your Zone**
Max 3x zoom. Must include either both sides of body of water or the horizon. If a body of water is visible from the hider's zone, but no part of it touches the zone, it does not count. However, if a large body of water partially touches the hider's zone, but the part of it inside the zone is smaller than another body of water in the zone, the larger overall body water would still be considered the largest in the zone.

**5 Buildings**
Must include bottom and up to four stories.

After a photo question has been answered, the hider may **draw 1 card and keep 1**.

### TENTACLE QUESTIONS

Tentacle questions follow the format, "Within _____ km of me, which _____ are you nearest to? (You must also be within _____.)" If the hider is within the reach of the tentacle question, they must answer with the name of one of the locations requested. If the hider is not within reach of the tentacle question, they may simply answer that they are not within reach. Hiders have five minutes to answer. These questions are most useful near the end of the game, to quickly dispense of density at an extremely high cost. To help visualize this, think of each of these locations (say, all the zoos) becoming tentacles that shoot out from the seekers. They feel around, and one will hit the hider and ping back.

After a tentacle question has been answered, the hider may **draw 4 cards and keep 2**.

Here's a little diagram to help illustrate how tentacle questions can work:

**HIDER IS IN YELLOW AREA**

[Diagram showing Hider's Closest Zoo, Zoo #3, 15 KM radius, Seekers position, Zoo #2, Zoo #1]

Tentacle questions cannot be used in **SMALL** games. These are the tentacle questions available to the seekers in **MEDIUM** sized games:

**Museums Within 2 km**
Anything correctly categorized as a museum by your mapping app.

**Libraries Within 2 km**
Anything correctly categorized as a library by your mapping app.

**Movie Theaters Within 2 km**
Anything correctly categorized as a movie theater by your mapping app.

**Hospitals Within 2 km**
Anything correctly categorized as a hospital by your mapping app.

#### FOR LARGE SIZED GAMES, ADD THE FOLLOWING:

**Metro Lines Within 25 km**
These will be drawn as colored lines in Google Maps.

**Zoos Within 25 km**
Anything correctly categorized as a zoo by your mapping app.

**Aquariums Within 25 km**
Anything correctly categorized as an aquarium by your mapping app.

**Amusement Parks Within 25 km**
Anything correctly categorized as an amusement park by your mapping app.

## SECTION 4: HIDING

As the hider, it is your job to stay hidden for as long as possible; stay hidden for longer than anyone else, and the game is yours. At the start of each run, you'll be given a certain amount of time to choose—and travel to—a hiding zone somewhere on your map. While the seekers close in, you'll have to juggle the tasks of answering questions, scoping out a perfect final hiding spot, and assembling the perfect hand using cards from the hider deck.

### HIDING ZONES

Your hiding zone is a circle located somewhere within the game map—once the seekers start seeking, this zone is your new home.

Depending on game size, you'll have a certain amount of time—the hiding period—to get from wherever the round starts to your hiding zone. Much like any other part of the game, you'll only be able to use your pre-established transit system to get to your hiding zone during this time, so make sure you plan on going somewhere you know you can get to. If the hiding period ends and you're somewhere else, then that's where your hiding zone is.

Choosing the right hiding zone is the single most impactful decision you'll make during your run, but there's rarely a "right" answer for where to hide. Out-of-the-way locations on the edges of your transit network can be harder to identify and travel to during the long game, but that sparseness is a double-edged sword; once the seekers have narrowed down the map, the relative lack of possible transit stations near your location can make it much easier to identify your exact hiding zone. Likewise, the densest parts of your map offer the protection of complexity, but offer the seekers easier transit opportunities and leave you exposed to a potentially devastating tentacle question.

**Every hiding zone must be centered on a transit station**; there may be other transit stations within your zone, but you'll have to choose a particular transit station to be "your" transit station. Many of the seekers' questions will reference this station or force you to take pictures around it, so it's important that you know which station this is. The rest of your zone extends a certain distance outwards from this station—in small and medium games, this zone is drawn as a 500 m radius from the icon for that station on your map; in large games, it is a 1 km radius. You must stay in this circle for your entire round.

When in your hiding zone, you're free to do whatever you like—go shopping, have a meal, see the sights—but don't get too distracted! Many photo questions will involve going somewhere else in your zone to take a photo of something in a fairly short window of time. If you'd like, you can take these photos ahead of time to give you more flexibility to freely wander your zone. We would also recommend spending some time scoping out a final hiding spot, which we detail below.

### HIDING SPOTS

Once the seekers have entered your hiding zone and the end game has begun, you must stay put in a single spot until they've found you—this is your final hiding spot.

Hiding spots can be anywhere within your hiding zone, but they must be somewhere that is **publicly accessible during all game hours** (all hours you will be playing, excluding rest periods). You cannot, for example, hide in a bathroom stall or someone's house. This does not mean that your hiding spot has to be on literal public property, but rather that the seekers must be able to access it at any point during the game. You should also make sure that staying in your spot for an extended period of time will not raise any suspicions or create the potential for you to get kicked out—for this reason we'd suggest avoiding stores or other businesses, even if they are open during all game hours.

Your hiding spot must also be **within 3 meters of a marked path or road on the map app(s) that you are using for your game**—no wandering off into the wilderness or swimming out to sea. Viable paths and roads should be easy to discern on any map, but if there's any question as to whether one counts, the test is whether or not your map app will use them for walking directions. In other words, the seekers should be able to theoretically follow a route generated by the app to within 3 meters of your hiding spot.

Your hiding spot is considered final the moment that the end game starts. If you aren't where you want to be when the seekers enter your hiding zone, too bad—wherever you're standing at that moment is your hiding spot. (If, for whatever reason, you aren't somewhere publicly accessible when the end game starts, you must immediately go to the nearest possible publicly accessible spot and stay there instead.)

We recommend spending some time scoping out your zone and looking for the perfect hiding spot—a clever enough spot can buy you an hour or more even after the seekers have found your station.

### THE HIDER DECK

The hider deck is your one and only weapon to use against the seekers, so you'll have to use it wisely.

Every time the seekers ask a question, you will get to draw and keep a certain number of cards from the hider deck (*e.g. measuring questions allow you to draw 3 and keep 1—this means that you look at the top 3 cards of the deck, put 1 in your hand, and discard the other 2*.) You can keep up to 6 cards in your hand at one time (or more, if you draw the right powerup); if, at any point, your hand is full and you must draw another card, you must immediately play or discard cards until only 6 remain.

Cards drawn from the hider deck can provide you with all sorts of advantages—some in response to questions, some at the end of your round, and some whenever you think they make the most sense. In total, there are three different types of cards you can draw from the hider deck: Time Bonuses, Powerups, and Curses.

#### TIME BONUSES

Time bonus cards come in varying values and count towards the hider's final hiding time. These cards cannot be "played," and the only way that they leave the hider's hand is if they are discarded. Time bonuses are added to the hider's final hiding time **only if they are in the hider's hand at the end of the round**; discarding a time bonus means that it will no longer count towards your final hiding time. You should aim to hold as many time bonuses at the end of a round as possible. Time bonuses automatically scale based on your game size, so three values are listed on each card. Make sure you're using the right one for your game size!

#### POWERUPS

There are several different types of powerup cards you can draw from the hider deck. These cards can be played at any time and allow you to take a particular type of advantageous action a single time; once powerup cards have been used, they are discarded and leave your hand. You only need to inform the seekers that you are using a powerup if that powerup has some kind of direct effect on them that they need to know about. These are the powerups in the hider deck:

**Veto**
The veto powerup can be played in response to any question instead of answering. The seekers are given no answer to their question, and are instead informed that you have used a veto. The question is still considered to have been asked, and therefore can only be asked again for its additional cost. Since you have not answered their question, however, you are given no reward and do not draw any cards from the hider deck. You may play a veto at any time during the response window after a question has been asked.

**Randomize**
The randomize powerup can be played in response to any question instead of answering. After the seekers have been informed that you have used a randomize powerup, they must choose—at random, using either a random number generator or dice—a different unasked question from the same category (*e.g. a 15 km radar might become a 80 km radar*.) This question is then automatically asked instead, and you provide an answer as normal. The original question is **not** considered to have been asked, and can therefore be asked again for its original cost. If the randomize causes a question to be asked that returns a null answer, this is permitted (tough luck, though). You may play a randomize at any time during the response window after a question has been asked.

**Discard 1, draw 2 and Discard 2, draw 3**
These powerups can be played at any time and allow you to dispose of some undesirable cards in your hand in exchange for new random draws. For example, if you play 'Discard 1, draw 2' you will discard one undesirable card from your hand, and then draw and keep two new ones. Because the 'Discard 1, draw 2' card will also leave your hand when you play it, you will end up with the same number of cards you started with. If you do not have enough extra cards to discard, these powerups cannot be played.

**Draw 1, expand maximum hand size by 1**
This powerup can be played at any time and immediately does two things: firstly, it allows you to draw and keep 1 card from the top of the deck. Secondly, it expands your hand to hold one extra card for the rest of the round, meaning you can keep up to 7 cards at once (or 8 if two of these powerups have been played.)

**Duplicate**
The duplicate powerup can be played as an exact copy of any other card—curse, powerup, or time bonus—currently in your hand. Once played, the original card will remain in your hand and can still be played later. If a duplicate remains in your hand at the end of the round, it can be used as a copy of any time bonus in your hand, effectively doubling that bonus.

**Move**
The move powerup, if played at the right moment, can be one of the most powerful cards in the game. When played, you are granted a certain amount of time based on game size to establish a **new hiding zone**. The rules for finding a new hiding zone apply as usual: you must center yourself on a new transit station, and you can only use valid transit to reach your new location. While you move, your hiding timer is paused, and the seekers must stay where they are and refrain from asking questions until the move timer is up. At this point, the game resumes, and your hiding timer continues from where it was at the moment you played the move powerup. It is crucial to do this at the perfect moment, as playing the move comes at a severe cost—you must immediately **discard your entire hand and inform the seekers of your original transit station after playing it**. Given that the move cannot be played during the end game, this means that you must be confident that the seekers are close to finding you, *and* that you are better off starting from scratch instead of using the cards you've already accumulated over the course of your round. Play it wisely!

#### CURSES

Curse cards are played against the seekers as a means to slow them down, prevent them from asking questions, or just to annoy them. Every curse is unique, and has some kind of one-time effect on the seekers that lasts for a certain duration; much like powerups, once a curse has been used, it is then discarded and removed from your hand.

Curses cannot necessarily be played at any time; each curse has a **casting cost** that must be met before it can be played. In some cases, these casting costs are resources that must be paid by the hider, such as discarding other cards in your hand. In other cases, these casting costs reference certain conditions of the game, such as requiring that the seekers are at least 15 km away. (You may notice that, on the cards, these casting costs are sometimes different for different game sizes, which will be indicated by game size icons next to each cost.)

You may play multiple curses at once, **but there cannot be more than one active curse preventing the seekers from asking questions or taking transit**. If a curse is actively preventing the seekers from asking questions or taking transit, you must wait for the curse to be cleared before you can play another curse. In these cases, the seekers must inform you once they have cleared a curse.

For any rules disputes, here are additional notes for each curse in the hider deck:

**Curse of the Luxury Car**
You must be able to identify the car in question when sending the photo, and the seekers must agree that it is, in fact, the car that you claim that it is. Use the MSRP of the car, factoring in its year of production, and disregarding any add-ons or modifications that may have been paid for. (For example: upgrades to the car's interior, special tires, custom colors, etc.) The photo sent to the seekers must include enough of the car for it to be identifiable. All of these rules also apply to the car found by the seekers. If you cannot confirm a car's exact production year or exact model, both sides must come to a consensus on which model and year to use for determining price.

**Curse of the Bridge Troll**
"Bridge" is defined as any elevated structure, acting as a path, road or railway, intended to be crossed by pedestrians, cars, or other vehicles. All seekers must have some part of their body under some part of the bridge when the next question is asked. If there are no bridges on the game map, this curse should be removed from the deck.

**Curse of the Drained Brain**
This curse may be used (and its price paid) during the time interval between a question and its answer, allowing a player to discard their hand before receiving the reward from a given question. You may not, however, ban the question that has just been asked, even if you have not yet answered it. Questions removed from the game using this curse cannot be asked, even for increased cost.

**Curse of the Water Weight**
Any liquid already traveling with the seekers at the time that this curse is played (e.g. water bottles) does not count. The liquid can be in any number of containers, and can be passed back and forth between seekers at any time. The liquid can be set down when the seekers are stationary or on transit, but it is considered "abandoned" once it is no longer within 3 meters of any seeker. The hider must be informed of their bonus immediately. "Body of water" within this context does not necessarily mean natural, but it cannot be a pool and must be large enough to be marked on the map.

**Curse of the Zoologist**
"Bug" in this context refers to any insect, arachnid, diplopoda, chilopoda, or anything else that would be colloquially and commonly referred to as a "bug." "Wild" in this context means undomesticated and not kept in human captivity, including large-scale outdoor instances of captivity, such as farms or sanctuaries. The photo must include enough of the animal that it is recognizable within its category. If there is any dispute as to an animal's classification, defer to Wikipedia. Animals outside of any of these categories (such as crustaceans) cannot be used for this curse.

**Curse of the Egg Partner**
The egg can be from any type of animal, but it must be a real egg (a chocolate egg or a plastic egg, for example, would not count.) Any visible fracture, however small, counts as killing the egg. If you do not want to buy items during the course of your game, or object to this curse on ethical grounds, this curse should be removed from the deck. For any other curse that requires all seekers to do something, the egg counts as a seeker. For example, using the Curse of the Lemon Phylactery after this curse has been played would require the egg to have a lemon attached to it.

**Curse of the Jammed Door**
Seekers must roll two d6 dice. Dice can only be rolled to enter a doorway once the doorway is visible to the seekers. For example, if you are attempting to roll to enter a train, you cannot roll the dice before the train arrives; you must be able to see the train door first. Doorways within a building that lead to other parts of the same building, such as a store within a train station, do not need to pass a dice check. If there is any reasonable dispute as to whether something counts as a separate building, err on the side of doing a dice check. If the curse expires while a doorway is on cooldown, that cooldown also immediately expires.

**Curse of the Spotty Memory**
The seekers should assign die numbers to each category before their first roll. For small-sized games, which only include five categories of questions, a six would result in a reroll.

**Curse of the Bird Guide**
The bird must be in frame from the moment the video starts. It is considered "in frame" so long as there is any recognizable portion of the bird on camera. The seekers have unlimited attempts to accomplish this.

**Curse of the Unguided Tourist**
The human-built structure in question cannot be any part of a road, including curbs or sidewalks. If you are playing in a country or area with highly limited Google Street View coverage (such as Germany), this curse should be removed from the deck.

**Curse of the Ransom Note**
You cannot begin fulfilling the casting cost of this curse if you would be otherwise unable to play a curse; once the cost is fulfilled, this curse must be cast immediately. The printed material cannot be printed by the seekers; the letters should be gathered from magazines, newspapers, or any other material that the seekers encounter in the wild. "Coherence" in this context does not necessarily mean complete sentences, but the hider should be able to discern the meaning of the question without further clarification. You may use easy-to-understand abbreviations for certain words (such as a "2" instead of "to".) If the question requires additional context outside of the basic sentence itself, this context does NOT need to be provided in the form of a ransom note. For example, if you are asking a thermometer question, you can simply ask something along the lines of, "Went 10 km. Hotter/colder?" Any information about where you started and ended the thermometer can be provided as normal, in the form of a location pin or text.

**Curse of the Mediocre Travel Agent**
"Publicly accessible" in this context follows the same rules as "publicly accessible" in the context of hiding spots. The destination does not need to be a single point; it can be a small general area like a park or store. The souvenir can be literally any physical object. It does not need to be with the seekers at all times, but it must be with them at the moment that the hider is caught.

**Curse of the Cairn**
You cannot begin fulfilling the casting cost of this curse if you would be otherwise unable to play a curse; once the cost is fulfilled, this curse must be cast immediately. "Found in nature," in this context, does not necessarily mean found in a natural space or untouched by humans; it simply means that you must find the rocks yourself, and cannot buy them.

**Curse of the Distant Cuisine**
The restaurants used for this curse must explicitly reference a single country or region within a single country in either their name or some other public-facing material such as a menu. If a restaurant associates itself with multiple countries or a region larger than a single country (such as an "Asian" restaurant), it cannot be used for this curse. Distance from a given country is measured from your exact location to the nearest point in that country.

**Curse of the Lemon Phylactery**
The lemon must be a real lemon. It can be affixed using any means, but must be constantly touching the seeker's skin or clothes. Once the lemon falls, the hider should be informed of their bonus immediately. "Cemetery," in this context, refers to any land specifically designated as a burial ground.

**Curse of the Gambler's Feet**
The die rolled for this curse must be a d6. If there are multiple seekers, seekers may choose to roll independently or have one die dictate steps for all seekers at once; either is acceptable. If seekers accidentally take extra steps, they should stop and roll the die retroactively until they have made up for the unaccounted steps. Seekers cannot take unaccounted steps on purpose, except in situations where it would be unsafe to not take extra steps (such as crossing a busy road.)

**Curse of the Hidden Hangman**
The chosen five-letter word must be a real word, found in a dictionary, in the language that the game is being played in. You cannot, for example, use a French word if all players only speak English. If the hider ever fails to respond to a query in 30 seconds, this curse is instantly cleared.

**Curse of the Endless Tumble**
30 meters is measured parallel to the ground. The die can, and likely should, be rolled on an inclined surface. If the die is lost or does not land cleanly on one side, it cannot be counted. Any bonuses awarded to the hider should be delivered immediately.

**Curse of the Right Turn**
This curse only applies to street intersections, meaning the intersection between two roads intended for cars (or the pedestrian sidewalks along those roads.) This curse would not have any effect indoors, or in an area where there are no streets.

**Curse of the Urban Explorer**
Any pending questions that were asked on transit before this curse was played must still be answered. Questions can still be asked outside of transit stations, but seekers cannot be on a platform or in any building associated with the transit station when asking questions.

**Curse of the Overflowing Chalice**
Matching questions become draw 4, keep 1. Measuring questions become draw 4, keep 1. Thermometer questions become draw 3, keep 1. Radar questions become draw 3, keep 1. Photo questions become draw 2, keep 1. Tentacle questions become draw 5, keep 2.

**Curse of the Labyrinth**
"Solvable," in this context, refers to a conventional solution to the maze—you must be able to draw an unbroken line from the start of the maze to the end of the maze. Your time limit begins from the moment you draw your first line; time spent gathering materials does not count. You may discard your maze and start drawing a new maze at any point, but you cannot restart your timer. You may not consult the internet or any other materials when drawing your maze; it must come entirely from your own head.

#### CUSTOMIZING YOUR DECK

We've provided you with a default hider deck that should most likely work out of the box without any adjustments. We do, however, encourage you to tinker with the deck and have provided some blank cards to help you customize it if you wish.

The default hider deck includes a set of curse cards that we believe are well-balanced and should be doable in *most* conditions, but it is entirely possible that there are curses that are **not possible** or at least not feasible given the scope or area of your game. There are also curses that may require spending small amounts of money—or are otherwise undesirable for the vibe that you are trying to cultivate—that you may want to take out of the deck. If you decide to remove any curses, we'd encourage you to use the blank cards to write some custom curses of your own to replace them. Generally, we recommend that your deck be about **50% time bonus cards, 25% powerup cards, and 25% curses**, but these ratios can be adjusted up or down depending on how much agency you want to give the hider.

## SECTION 5: GENERAL TIPS

Make no mistake, *Hide and Seek* is a physically and mentally demanding game. Particularly for medium and large games, which can last multiple days, adequate preparation is hugely important and should not be disregarded when organizing your game. Here are a few tips for staying healthy and comfortable while playing *Hide and Seek*:

**Always pack enough food and water for at least one full day of gameplay**. As the hider, you may very well find yourself in situations where there is no way to access food or water for hours at a time. Use the rest period to restock any snacks you might have consumed during the game day.

Consider **weather in all parts of the game map**, across every day you'll be playing. Look out in particular for mountainous regions, where the weather may drop precipitously, or areas prone to flash rainstorms—you do not want to be playing *Hide and Seek* soaking wet.

In any configuration of the game, we **highly recommend that all players carry a portable battery** to charge their phones. You will be using your phone fairly often for research and communication, and there is a very good chance it will not last a full day of gameplay.

When choosing a hiding zone, ensure that there is a **bathroom you can access** somewhere in the zone. Smaller train stations and bus stops may not have bathrooms at all, so try to identify restaurants or stores within the zone that would have bathrooms.

On a similar note, check your hiding zone for hotels ahead of time if your game spans multiple days and is far from home. You can, of course, **leave your hiding zone during the rest period** if you need to find a place to stay, but this is not recommended—rest time is important!

You always have the option to **pause the game** if it becomes necessary. Do your best to not abuse this or use it for any kind of strategic advantage, but your safety and comfort always come first. When the game is paused, the hider's timer and any other in-game timers stop. When the game is resumed, all players must be in the same spot where the game was originally paused.

As mentioned in an earlier section: **ensure that your map only includes areas where all players will feel safe traveling**. You should discuss safety before playing the game, and ensure that you have blocked out any areas of the map where any player would not feel comfortable going

Also for safety reasons, it's a good idea for the **hider and seekers to share their locations with a third party who is not playing the game**. Should anything unexpected happen—a weather or health emergency, say—it will be good for someone else to know where you are.

## SECTION 6: EXPERIMENTAL GAME DESIGNS

In previous sections, we've detailed the rules for conventional configurations of *Hide and Seek*. We have, however, considered some alternate versions of the game, and we thought we'd detail those here in case you'd like to try them—or use them as a jumping off point for your own game mode!

### PLAYING WITH CARS (OR ON FOOT)

It is not lost on us that your hometown may not have sufficient public transit to play even the smallest version of *Hide and Seek*. Of course, there's always the possibility of playing when you're out of town, but you may still be determined to make it work with cars and feet. In this case, you'll have to make a few modifications to the game's traditional ruleset:

**Setting Your Map**: Without a transit system, setting your map will become a matter of simply setting map borders. Make sure that these are drawn carefully, as it'll be even easier to confuse what is or isn't a valid hiding spot without a transit system.

**Hiding Zones**: Hiding zones will still be drawn as a circle with a radius of varying size, depending on game size, somewhere on the map. Instead of being anchored on a transit station, you should choose a **street terminus** to act as the center of your zone—that means the point at which one street ends, either at an intersection with another street or a dead end. This street terminus should serve the same role as your transit station; photos that would normally be taken at a transit station would be taken there, questions referencing transit station names would reference that street's name, etc.

**Questions**: Most questions will still work as intended. Ignore any questions that reference transit frequency. As mentioned, some questions that reference the hider's transit station will reference their street terminus instead.

**Curses**: Any curses that cannot be played while seekers are on transit should not be played when the seekers are in a moving car. Curses that prevent the seekers from taking "transportation" or "transit"—or impede them from doing something in transit—include cars.

### PLAYING WITH TWO TEAMS OF SEEKERS

We've always liked the idea of playing with two teams of seekers, competing against each other to find the same hider. Ultimately, we never used this version of the game for our show given the number of narrative threads and players it would require to pull off. You, however, are probably *not* making a show, and therefore might actually be able to make this work.

In this version of the game, scores would **not be determined by hiding time**. Instead, players would be competing for the **best seeking time**. This can be done in one of two ways: by points or by overall lowest seeking time.

**The winner is determined by points**. Each round is worth **one point**. The seeker team with the lowest seeking time (as in: fastest time to find the hider) is awarded the point. In this configuration of the game, the hider is an entirely neutral party during their hiding run—one of the other teams is awarded the point no matter what. With no incentive to slow teams down, the hider does not have control of the hider deck. Instead, the hider administrates splitting the between both teams of seekers. Once a team asks the hider a question, the hider does the proper card draw, and then informs the other team of their reward. The teams of seekers are able to track and cast curses on each other, and time bonuses subtract time from their final seeking time. Veto and randomize powerups are removed from the deck. After each round, the positions cycle, and one team of seekers serves as the neutral hiding team for the next round.

**The winner is determined by overall lowest seeking time**. This means the fastest time to find the hider in any round. Here, the hider *does* actually have an incentive to choose a difficult hiding spot and slow both teams down, as they are competing against the scores earned during their hiding run. They maintain control of the hider deck, and are able to cast curses against whichever team they choose. Seekers in this version of the game do not really interact—they do not have trackers on each other, and do not have any means of slowing each other down; it is simply a race to get the faster time.

In either case, many mechanics of the game can remain unchanged. Map set-up would follow the same rules, as would any conditions for choosing hiding zones and hiding spots. In configurations where the seekers control the hiding deck, some curses would need to be removed or modified; specifically, curses with costs that reference the seekers' distance from the hider would not be playable, as the other team of seekers would not know whether or not the cost was fulfilled. If you plan on playing some version of this game, we would recommend writing a few custom curses—or even powerups—that are specifically designed to be played by seekers.

### GLOBAL HIDE AND SEEK

Should you do this? No. Will it work? Probably not. Is someone going to try anyway? Almost certainly. So here are a few thoughts on how *Hide and Seek* could work across the entire globe.

Firstly, you almost certainly won't be able to dictate a *specific* list of transit networks that are included in your game, so you'll have to set a general set of parameters for valid transit stations instead. For example, this game might include "commercial airports that serve at least 100,000 passengers annually," and "non-metro train stations."

Secondly, the basic time scale we've provided for **large games** would not work here. You would need to use a new global time scale. Hiding periods would last 24 hours. Scalable time bonuses, time penalties, and time limits would follow large-scale values multiplied by 5.

Many—or most—curses would need to be removed and replaced. Curses that aim to slow seekers down by distracting them with an activity—such as Curse of the Cairn—would be essentially useless at this scale. You would almost certainly want to write new curses that correspond with the amount of time and money being spent in this version of the game. Perhaps a curse that sends the seekers scuba diving for a particular kind of shell? A curse that forces them to climb a mountain of a certain height? A curse that forces them to camp on a deserted island?

You'll also need to add more questions, in almost every category. Add hemisphere, continent, and country to matching; add the equator and national capital to measuring; add much larger radars; additional thermometers; probably a whole new larger category of tentacles. All kinds of stuff.

Anyway, there's almost no way that this game could be properly balanced. Don't do it. Spend your money on something sensible. Put it in a mutual fund or something. Please don't do this. (But if you do, let us know. We're just the tiniest bit interested in what might happen.)
