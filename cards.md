# Hide and Seek - Cards

## Curse Cards

### Curse of the Bird Guide
**Casting cost:** Film a bird.

You have one chance to film a bird for as long as possible, up to **S 5 / M 10 / L 15** minutes straight. If, at any point, the bird leaves the frame, your timer is stopped. The seekers must then film a bird for the same amount of time or longer before asking another question.

---

### Curse of the Bridge Troll
**Casting cost:** Seekers must be at least **S 2 / M 10 / L 50** km from you.

The seekers must ask their next question from under a bridge.

---

### Curse of the Cairn
**Casting cost:** Build a rock tower.

You have one attempt to stack as many rocks on top of each other as you can in a freestanding tower. Each rock may only touch one other rock. Once you have added a rock to the tower, it may not be removed. Before adding another rock, the tower must stand for at least five seconds. If at any point, any rock other than the base rock touches the ground, your tower has fallen. Once your tower falls, tell the seekers how many rocks high your tower was when it last stood for five seconds. The seekers must then construct a rock tower of the same number of rocks, under the same parameters, before asking another question. If their tower falls, they must restart. The rocks must be found in nature, and both teams must disperse the rocks after building.

---

### Curse of the Distant Cuisine
**Casting cost:** You must be at the restaurant.

Find a restaurant within your zone that explicitly serves food from a specific foreign country. The seekers must visit a restaurant serving food from a country that is an equal or greater distance away before asking another question.

**Casting cost:** Discard your hand.

Choose three questions in different categories. The seekers cannot ask those questions for the rest of your run.

---

### Curse of the Egg Partner
**Casting cost:** Discard two cards.

The seekers must acquire an egg before asking another question. This egg is now treated as an official team member of the seekers. If any team members are abandoned or killed (defined as any crack, in the egg's case) before the end of your run, you are awarded an extra **S 30 / M 45 / L 60** minutes. This curse cannot be played during the endgame.

---

### Curse of the Endless Tumble
**Casting cost:** Roll a die. If it's a 5 or a 6, this card has no effect.

Seekers must roll a die at least 30 meters and have it land on a 5 or a 6 before they can ask another question. The die must roll the full distance, unaided, using only the momentum from the initial throw and gravity to travel the 30 meters. If the seekers accidentally hit someone with a die, you are awarded a **S 10 / M 20 / L 30** minute bonus.

---

### Curse of the Gambler's Feet
**Casting cost:** Roll a die. If it's an even number, this curse has no effect.

---

### Curse of the Hidden Hangman
**Casting cost:** Discard 2 cards.

Before asking another question or boarding another form of transportation, seekers must beat the hider in a game of hangman. To play, the hider chooses a 5 letter word, and the game ends after either a correct word guess or 7 wrong letter guesses (head, body, two arms, two legs, and a hat). The hider must respond to all queries within 30 seconds. The seekers cannot challenge the hider for 10 minutes after a loss. After **S 1 / M 2 / L 3** losses, the seekers must wait 10 more minutes and then the curse is cleared.

### Curse of the Impressionable Consumer
**Casting cost:** The seekers' next question is free.

### Curse of the Jammed Door
**Casting cost:** Discard two cards.

For the next **S 0.5 / M 1 / L 3** hours, whenever the seekers want to pass through a doorway into a building, business, train, or other vehicle, they must first roll 2 dice. If they do not roll a 7 or higher, they cannot enter that space (including through other doorways.) Any given doorway can be re-attempted after **S 5 / M 10 / L 15** minutes.

---

### Curse of the Labyrinth
**Casting cost:** Draw a maze.

Spend up to **S 10 / M 20 / L 30** minutes drawing a solvable maze and send a photo of it to the seekers. You cannot use the internet to research maze designs. The seekers must solve the maze before asking another question.

### Curse of the Lemon Phylactery
**Casting cost:** Discard a powerup.

If this souvenir is lost before they can give it to you, you are awarded an extra **S 30 / M 45 / L 60** minutes.

For the next **S 20 / M 40 / L 60** minutes, the seekers can only turn right at any street intersection. If, at any point, they find themselves in a dead end where they cannot continue forward or turn right for another 300 meters, they may do a full 180. A right turn is defined as a road at any angle that veers to the right of the seekers.

---

### Curse of Spotty Memory
**Casting cost:** Discard a time bonus.

For the rest of your run, one random category of questions will be disabled at all times. After this curse is played, seekers must roll a die to determine the category of questions to be disabled. This category remains disabled until the next question is asked, at which point a die is rolled again to choose a new category. The same category can be disabled multiple times in a row.

---

### Curse of the U-Turn
**Casting cost:** Seekers must be heading the wrong way. (Their next station is further from you than they are.)

The seekers must disembark their current mode of transportation at the next station (as long as that station is serviced by another form of transit in the next **S 0.5 / M 0.5 / L 1** hours.)

### Curse of the Unguided Tourist
**Casting cost:** Seekers must be outside.

Send the seekers an unzoomed Google Street View image from a street within 150 meters of where they are now. The shot has to be parallel to the horizon and include at least one human-built structure other than a road.
